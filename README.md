My very first project with Nodejs

Technology using: ExpressJS, EmbeddedJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, Node Package Management, Node Version Management, Cookies, Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), Json Web Token (JWT), BscriptJS, EJS Lint, DOT ENV and Bootstrap.

About the web:
  - There two roles: User and Admin.
  - With user:
       + Can compose, edit and view posts.
       + Can update information, and delete account.
  - With admin:
       + Have the same function like users but I add some for extra.
       + Can view all users, all blogs
       + In user list, they can delete, ...updating
       + In blog list, they can delete, ...updating

This project I made for praticing and learning purposes. If you see something helpful from it, please give this repo a star.

Many thanks and have a good day!!!
